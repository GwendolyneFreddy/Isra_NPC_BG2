		<h2>Introduction</h2><br>

		  <p>
			This mod adds Isra Ghadir, a cavalier paladin of Sune Firehair, to Baldur's Gate II. A follower of the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, Isra isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though). She is amiable, optimistic, and courteous almost to a fault. She is also still somewhat inexperienced, and not too proud or rigid to admit when she's wrong.
		  </p>

		  <p>
			You can find her in the Den of the Seven Vales in Waukeen's Promenade, where she is looking into some family concerns. She will not immediately join the party, though you will have the chance to establish whether or not you knew her in BG. If you met her in Nashkel, you may either continue from where you left off or start anew as strangers. There will be significant differences in her early dialogue depending upon which you choose. She is playable through to the end of Throne of Bhaal.

		<h2>Compatibility</h2><br>

		<p>
			Isra NPC for BGII is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2:EE).</li>
			<li>The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion. <strong>Make sure you have Throne of Bhaal patched to version 26498.</strong> Check the ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/throne_bhaal/support/patches/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.</li>
			<li>The conversion projects based on <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>, <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/"><strong>Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases"><strong>Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</strong></a>.</li>
		</ul></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; color: #781808; background-color: #781808; " /><br>


		<p>
			The Isra NPC mod for BGII is only compatible with BGII: ToB. This is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/638-isra/">report them on the forum</a>!
		</p>
		<p>
			Although it is not required for the Isra NPC mod to function properly, classical game players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.

		<h2>Installation</h2><br>

		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;setup-isra_bg2.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the isra_bg2 folder.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can extract files from the archive using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="http://www.zipgenius.it/ita/?page_id=12">ZipGenius</a> or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; color: #781808; background-color: #781808; " /><br>


		<h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; color: #781808; background-color: #781808; " /><br>


		<h3>Windows</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Isra NPC for BGII for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be an isra_bg2 folder and a setup-isra_bg2.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;setup-isra_bg2.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;setup-isra_bg2.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; color: #781808; background-color: #781808; " /><br>


		<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Isra NPC for BGII for Mac OS X distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be an isra_bg2 folder, setup-isra_bg2 and setup-isra_bg2.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;setup-isra_bg2.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can run <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;setup-isra_bg2.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; color: #781808; background-color: #781808; " /><br>


		<h3>Linux</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Isra NPC for BGII for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Then open a terminal and <strong>cd</strong> to your game installation directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;WeInstall setup-isra_bg2&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;wine BGMain.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and start playing.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; color: #781808; background-color: #781808; " /><br>


		<h3>Note for Complete Un-installation</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using <strong><span style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;border: 1px solid black;background-color: black;color: #deded9;">&nbsp;setup-isra_bg2 --uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.

				Isra is a twenty-one year old paladin with the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, an order devoted to Sune Firehair. As a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins, Isra has far more experience with (and sympathy for) the chaotic good churches of Sune and Lliira than any of the lawful churches, and associates with some of the most mirthful churches in the Realms.<br/>
				So her outlook and personality are somewhat removed from what you might expect from a paladin. Don't expect sermons or proselytism: the Firehair's faith is something better served by building close friendships than by lecturing dogma, and Isra understands that. She definitely still believes in honor, discipline, and order, but she tends to value the courtly aspects of the code of conduct more highly than the demands of duty. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though).</td>

		</p>

		<p>
			Isra is Amnish, most recently from Crimmor, the Caravan Capital of Amn, and she can be found in the Den of the Seven Vales in Waukeen's Promenade, where she is looking into some family concerns. She will not immediately join the party, though you will have the chance to establish whether or not you knew her in BG. There will be significant differences in her early dialogue depending upon which you choose.
		</p>

		<p>
			Like in BG, Isra will <strong>NOT</strong> join the party if the protagonist is of evil alignment. Your reputation has to be 10 or higher to begin a friendship or romance, and 14 or higher to advance it past a certain point. Don't let it drop below 6 if you want to keep her around.
		</p>

		<p>
			Isra will have several quests in Athkatla - one that begins when you first recruit her, and a related one that triggers after you've had her for a while. Your reputation will need to be 14 or higher to receive the second quest. If you like intrigue involving the merchant nobility, her storyline will probably appeal to you. On a related note, she's not entirely above family rivalries, so speaking to noblemen might win you some extra content.

			<li><strong>Anomen:</strong> Anomen does not play nice with paladins. Isra isn't impressed by his behavior, but she's disinclined to step on Radiant Heart toes by calling him out on it. They'll get along better once he passes his test, but don't expect them to ever really be friends.</li>
			<li><strong>Cernd:</strong> Isra doesn't really understand the whole druid thing, and Cernd kind of enjoys trolling her. They sort of get along, but not wonderfully.</li>
			<li><strong>Edwin:</strong> This is the closest things get to actual violence. Isra absolutely loathes Edwin, who definitely pushes the envelop a bit in seeing how offensive he can be without losing his head.</li>
			<li><strong>Haer'dalis:</strong> These two get along really well. Their relationship is actually a bit on the flirty side, though Isra is too disturbed by his philosophy to ever let it go anywhere.</li>
			<li><strong>Imoen:</strong> They got along fine in BG1 and they will again here.</li>
			<li><strong>Jaheira:</strong> They care about each other, but they're both pretty terrible when it comes to communicating that properly. Despite the personality clash, they get along reasonably well.</li>
			<li><strong>Jan:</strong> Jan is... well, Jan. Isra isn't thrilled with him, though she doesn't get too bent out of shape by the prodding.</li>
			<li><strong>Keldorn:</strong> Isra doesn't have much of any experience with Tormites, and isn't really sure what to expect. He wins her over pretty quickly, though.</li>
			<li><strong>Korgan:</strong> Isra's a Sunite. His crudeness is not going to go over well at all. Neither will anything else about him. He's got some respect for her since she's not afraid to back things up with violence, but he'll still rile her up whenever possible.</li>
			<li><strong>Mazzy:</strong> These two will have a close friendship, though Mazzy is a little bit exasperated at times by some of the Sunite tendencies.</li>
			<li><strong>Minsc:</strong> They get along well, though Isra isn't quite so fond of Boo. One of the banters only triggers if she was around in BG.</li>
			<li><strong>Nalia:</strong> They'll have a bit of trouble, though once they settle down, they'll mostly be fine. They've definitely got some things in common.</li>
			<li><strong>Valygar:</strong> Isra thinks Valygar is lonely and in need of a friend (and a god as well). Valygar thinks Isra is exhausting, though he doesn't have the heart to tell her so.</li>
			<li><strong>Viconia:</strong> They tolerate each other, though just barely. Viconia is less hostile than she'd be with a male paladin, but that doesn't say much.</li>
			<li><strong>Yoshimo:</strong> Yoshimo is a career thief, and Isra isn't too happy about that. They don't have any serious problems, though.</li>
		  </ul>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			<strong>BG2:EE content:</strong>
		  <ul>
			<li><strong>Dorn:</strong> Yeah, no. Don't mix blackguards and paladins. It will end violently.</li>
			<li><strong>Hexxat:</strong> See above. No violence this time, but Isra won't travel with her anymore than most of the good-aligned folk will.</li>
			<li><strong>Neera:</strong> They got along fine in BG1 and will again here.</li>
			<li><strong>Rasaad:</strong> Isra's really worried about his vendetta, but he's not really interested in advice.</li>

		<h2>Romance</h2><br>

		<p>
			Isra is, of course, romanceable in BGII by good-aligned protagonists with CHR 13+, regardless of race, class, or gender. Her romance is relatively easygoing and perhaps a bit on the slow burn side; don't expect declarations of everlasting love, demands for marriage, or anything along those lines. Isra may be very romantic, but she's also painfully aware of how difficult it is to balance romance and the paladin lifestyle.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because of the way that her BG friendship progressed and her relatively casual outlook, if she already knew you in Baldur's Gate, she will be willing to commit to a romance very early in the dialogue track. You won't get more content out of this track than the non-BG track, though there will obviously be significant differences in dialogue here and there.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you're not interested in or eligible for romancing Isra, she has friendship content as well. There are no stat or alignment requirements for a friendship - Isra has no problem with neutral-aligned people, she's just generally not romantically interested in them. Like in BG, however, she will not join the party if the PC is evil-aligned.

		<h3>Requirements</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
		  <ul>
			<li><strong>Gender:</strong> No restrictions.</li>
			<li><strong>Race:</strong> No restrictions.</li>
			<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Isra will only romance good-aligned protagonists.</li>
			<li><strong>Class restrictions:</strong> No restrictions.</li>
			<li><strong>Stat restrictions:</strong> CHR 13+.</li>
		  </ul>
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%; color: #781808; background-color: #781808; " /><br>


		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
		  <ul>
			<li><strong>You must commit to a romance before setting sail for Brynnlaw (Chapter 4).</strong> Given the nature of the plot of SoA, Isra's priorities will change somewhat after the events in Spellhold, and her early tracked dialogue will no longer be available. This is true for a friendship as well as a romance, but doubly important in a romance. Her dialogue is cut into two parts: the early stuff that happens before Spellhold, and a handful of additional talks (as well as one mini-quest contingent upon the Bodhi-napping) that are scattered afterwards. The earlier parts will ONLY trigger prior to Chapter 4. You may use PID to ensure you have not missed anything, however. Once her early tracked dialogue is exhausted, if you ask her what she thinks of the quest, she'll say she's worried about Imoen.</li>
			<li>The first ToB dialogue triggers upon rest after meeting Melissan. It is otherwise straightforward.</li>
			<li>Your reputation is important to advance both a friendship and a romance. She will not talk to a PC whose reputation is below 10, and your reputation will need to be at least 14 in order to get her second quest to trigger. If the romance has stalled, keep this in mind.</li>
			<li>Isra can take a bit of teasing as long as you're reasonably courteous, especially once she has committed to a romance. That said, insulting her faith is always dangerous.</li>
			<li>If you are continuing from BG1, Isra will commit to a romance very early. She'll test the waters a bit first to make sure you're interested also; if you're not, just tell her. It won't shut down a friendship.</li>
			<li>Isra is somewhat easygoing about romance. Given her faith, she can get extremely romantic at times, but she's also on the pragmatic side. Don't expect much in the way of proposals or declarations of everlasting love.</li>
		  </ul>
