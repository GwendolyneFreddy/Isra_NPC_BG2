## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds Isra Ghadir, a cavalier paladin of Sune Firehair, to Baldur's Gate II. A follower of the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, Isra isn't necessarily what you might expect of a paladin. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though). She is amiable, optimistic, and courteous almost to a fault. She is also still somewhat inexperienced, and not too proud or rigid to admit when she's wrong.

You can find her in the Den of the Seven Vales in Waukeen's Promenade, where she is looking into some family concerns. She will not immediately join the party, though you will have the chance to establish whether or not you knew her in BG. If you met her in Nashkel, you may either continue from where you left off or start anew as strangers. There will be significant differences in her early dialogue depending upon which you choose. She is playable through to the end of Throne of Bhaal.

**Content:**
- A new cavalier paladin NPC for BGII.
- Content for SoA, ToB and BG2EE.
- Voicing and background music.
- Banters with the original Bioware NPCs.
- A romance for eligible male or female protagonists.
- A friendship path for a protagonist not romancing her.
- Interjections and commentary.
- New encounters.
- Several new items.
- Player initiated dialogue and flirts.

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-isra_bg2.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **isra_bg2** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

Isra NPC for BGII for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: isra_bg2 folder and a setup-isra_bg2.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-isra_bg2.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-isra_bg2.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Isra NPC for BGII for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: isra_bg2 folder, setup-isra_bg2 and setup-isra_bg2.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-isra_bg2.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-isra_bg2.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Isra NPC for BGII for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-isra_bg2`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-isra_bg2 --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>

## <a name="details" id="details"></a>Details

<img style="float: left;" src="isra_bg2/readme/images/rhisral.png">
Isra is a twenty-one year old paladin with the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, an order devoted to Sune Firehair. As a follower of Sune Firehair, the goddess of love, beauty, and passion, and the only chaotic aligned deity to sponsor paladins, Isra has far more experience with (and sympathy for) the chaotic good churches of Sune and Lliira than any of the lawful churches, and associates with some of the most mirthful churches in the Realms.

So her outlook and personality are somewhat removed from what you might expect from a paladin. Don't expect sermons or proselytism: the Firehair's faith is something better served by building close friendships than by lecturing dogma, and Isra understands that. She definitely still believes in honor, discipline, and order, but she tends to value the courtly aspects of the code of conduct more highly than the demands of duty. As a result, she's usually pretty willing to ignore harmlessly chaotic behavior (not evil behavior, though).

Isra is Amnish, most recently from Crimmor, the Caravan Capital of Amn, and she can be found in the Den of the Seven Vales in Waukeen's Promenade, where she is looking into some family concerns. She will not immediately join the party, though you will have the chance to establish whether or not you knew her in BG. There will be significant differences in her early dialogue depending upon which you choose.

Like in BG, Isra will **NOT** join the party if the protagonist is of evil alignment. Your reputation has to be 10 or higher to begin a friendship or romance, and 14 or higher to advance it past a certain point. Don't let it drop below 6 if you want to keep her around.

Isra will have several quests in Athkatla - one that begins when you first recruit her, and a related one that triggers after you've had her for a while. Your reputation will need to be 14 or higher to receive the second quest. If you like intrigue involving the merchant nobility, her storyline will probably appeal to you. On a related note, she's not entirely above family rivalries, so speaking to noblemen might win you some extra content.

##

- Strength 16

#### Biography

> When asked about her past, Isra tells you that she is a newly instated knight of the Ruby Rose, a paladin order dedicated to Sune. She speaks warmly of her long training in Crimmor, the Caravan Capital of Amn, though despite her obvious nostalgia, she seems happy enough to finally be away from it and out in the world on her own.

#### NPC Relationships

There will be conflict, occasionally on the edge of violence, but you can keep him with any Bioware NPC without fearing a lethal outcome. Jaheira in particular is recommended, as her presence can significantly affect the epilogue. This is doubly true if you are romancing him.

#### Classes

Adrian was conceived of as a sorcerer, but his character and history lend themselves to the cleric/mage and mage/thief multiclasses as well. For this reason, both are included as alternative installation choices. Dialogue may vary in places to take this into account. Installing him as a sorcerer is still recommended, but both alternatives are internally consistent.



## <a name="romance" id="romance"></a>Romance

Isra is, of course, romanceable in BGII by good-aligned protagonists with CHR 13+, regardless of race, class, or gender. Her romance is relatively easygoing and perhaps a bit on the slow burn side; don't expect declarations of everlasting love, demands for marriage, or anything along those lines. Isra may be very romantic, but she's also painfully aware of how difficult it is to balance romance and the paladin lifestyle.

Because of the way that her BG friendship progressed and her relatively casual outlook, if she already knew you in Baldur's Gate, she will be willing to commit to a romance very early in the dialogue track. You won't get more content out of this track than the non-BG track, though there will obviously be significant differences in dialogue here and there.

If you're not interested in or eligible for romancing Isra, she has friendship content as well. There are no stat or alignment requirements for a friendship - Isra has no problem with neutral-aligned people, she's just generally not romantically interested in them. Like in BG, however, she will not join the party if the PC is evil-aligned.

## 

#### Requirements

- **Gender:** No restrictions.
- **Race:** No restrictions.
- **Alignment:** Isra will only romance good-aligned protagonists.
- **Class restrictions:** No restrictions.
- **Stat restrictions:** CHR 13+

## 

#### Notes

- **You must commit to a romance before setting sail for Brynnlaw (Chapter 4).** Given the nature of the plot of SoA, Isra's priorities will change somewhat after the events in Spellhold, and her early tracked dialogue will no longer be available. This is true for a friendship as well as a romance, but doubly important in a romance. Her dialogue is cut into two parts: the early stuff that happens before Spellhold, and a handful of additional talks (as well as one mini-quest contingent upon the Bodhi-napping) that are scattered afterwards. The earlier parts will ONLY trigger prior to Chapter 4. You may use PID to ensure you have not missed anything, however. Once her early tracked dialogue is exhausted, if you ask her what she thinks of the quest, she'll say she's worried about Imoen.
- The first ToB dialogue triggers upon rest after meeting Melissan. It is otherwise straightforward.
- Your reputation is important to advance both a friendship and a romance. She will not talk to a PC whose reputation is below 10, and your reputation will need to be at least 14 in order to get her second quest to trigger. If the romance has stalled, keep this in mind.
- Isra can take a bit of teasing as long as you're reasonably courteous, especially once she has committed to a romance. That said, insulting her faith is always dangerous.
- If you are continuing from BG1, Isra will commit to a romance very early. She'll test the waters a bit first to make sure you're interested also; if you're not, just tell her. It won't shut down a friendship.
- Isra is somewhat easygoing about romance. Given her faith, she can get extremely romantic at times, but she's also on the pragmatic side. Don't expect much in the way of proposals or declarations of everlasting love.
